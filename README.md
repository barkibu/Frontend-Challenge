# 👋 Welcome to the Barkibu Frontend Challenge
First of all, thank you for your interest. In Barkibu, we really appreciate people who like to challenge themselves. 
# ⚙️ Requirements
You need to create a page with a form that asks for the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- Birthdate

The page needs to be responsive. Try to follow the design in /design/desktop.png and /design/mobile.png 
The font is Nunito and the main color is hsla(210, 73%, 51%, 1).
We don't need the result to be pixel perfect, don't worry about that
(it's an ugly design, after all! 😅)

After clicking the submit button the form will disappear and the user
will be greeted with his/her data (see /design/success.png).


# 🧾 Instructions
- Clone the challenge repository to your local environment (Git + IDE)
- Put your code in a folder inside this repository
- You can use Vanilla, React, Vue, Angular or the technology you prefer to solve the challenge
- **Include a README.md file with the instructions to launch the project**

# 📤 How to submit

- Submit the solution pushing your code to the develop branch *We encorage you to commit regulary to show your thinking process*.


# 🍀 Good Luck!
